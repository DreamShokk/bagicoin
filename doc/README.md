Bagicoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Bagicoin Core is the original Bagicoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Bitcoin transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Bagicoin Core, visit [bagicoin.org](https://www.bagicoin.org/bagicoin-wallet/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Bagicoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bagicoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/bagicoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bagicoin-qt.exe.
